# Credit Risk Resampling Techniques and Ensemble Learning

## Overview

This repository contains two main scripts:

1. **Credit Risk Resampling Techniques**: This script demonstrates various resampling techniques to handle imbalanced datasets, using logistic regression to evaluate their performance.
2. **Ensemble Learning**: This script uses ensemble learning methods, including Balanced Random Forest and Easy Ensemble classifiers, to improve model performance on imbalanced datasets.

## Contents

- `credit_risk_resampling.py`: Script for resampling techniques and logistic regression.
- `ensemble_learning.py`: Script for ensemble learning methods.
- `Resources/`: Directory containing the datasets used (`lending_data.csv` and `LoanStats_2019Q1.csv`).

## Setup and Requirements

To run these scripts, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
```
